# CodeCuisine: A Drag-and-Drop Game for Teaching Programming to Kids

CodeCuisine is an educational game designed to teach kids the fundamentals of programming through a fun and interactive hamburger-making challenge. Using a drag-and-drop interface, players build recipes step by step with programming logic blocks like loops (for) and actions (add), combining ingredients to form the correct sequence. Once submitted, the system evaluates the logic and provides immediate feedback.

This project was developed on **March 2024** for Aulify, a company dedicated to teaching different academic topics to children. (This version is stripped of any company branding, logos, and sensitive features to comply with NDA agreements.)
